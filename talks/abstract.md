# Server-side is back, baby!
\- take a break from Javascript, write your apps with liveviews instead üöÄ

In this workshop, we explore *liveviews* as an alternative to ‚Äútraditional‚Äù client-side rendering ‚Äì a new way of building dynamic user interfaces for the web.

First, we give an introduction to liveviews using examples from established frameworks like [Phonix Liveview](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) for Elixir and [StimulusReflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/) for Ruby. We also touch on the emergent space of Django liveviews. Then, we showcase our interpretation of a Django liveview called [Hypergen](https://hypergen.it). Last, in the main part of the workshop, we build an example app in [Hypergen](https://github.com/runekaagaard/django-hypergen) while constrasting its architectural choices to other liveviews.

So are you looking for a break from Javascript, or if you‚Äôre just curious about what else is possible with Django, this talk is for you!
