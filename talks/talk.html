        <section>Server Side Rendering</section>
        <section>All the html rendering is performed by the server</section>
        <section>
            Client (browser) receives html and displays it to the user
            Django uses serverside rendering by default.
            We display our models to the user by defining django views which renderes the html by using templates.
            Its simple, easy to understand.

            The Problem: Rerendering the whole page on each user interaction.
            Its not that dynamic. It does not feel app like.
        </section>
        <section>Client Side Rendering</section>
        <section>Server is sending data usually in the form of JSON</section>
        <section>The browser (client) is rendering the actual HTML from this server data (JSON) by using a Javascript framework like React, Angular, Moment you name it.</section>

            Problems:
            Developers need to be able to switch between Javascript and Python
            A lot harder to maintain.
            A lot more frontend Javascript code.
            Serialization - we can't use djangos ORM in Javascript (We could try to use rest or graphql - lots of setup)
            Webpack - npm install sucks
            Frontend validation and Backend validation which is right?
            No single source of truth
            In general it feels like writing the same code twice - new model - setup serialization - map data for frontend.

            The Solution: Meet Server Side rendered Live Views
        </section>
        <section>
            With Live Views the server is again serving html.
            We also define user actions.
            Possible user actions are also defined on server
            A thin Javascript client enables us to partially redraw changed html.
            Everything is defined on the server.
            No need to maintain an expensive frontend written in Javascript.
