<h1>Django hypergen</h1>
<p>Write server-rendered reactive HTML liveviews for Django in pure python.</p>
<h2>Why hypergen?</h2>
<p>Say bye bye to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>frontend</li>
<li>javascript</li>
<li>mangling making data ready for serialization</li>
<li>serialization/deserialization</li>
<li>template language</li>
<li>webpack/NPM/parcel/gulp/redux/react/etc/etc/etc</li>
</ul>
<p>And hello to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>automatic liveview features</li>
<li>composable pure python templates</li>
<li>easy dataformat to perform custom frontend actions</li>
<li>automatic serialization/deserialization from backend-&gt;frontend and frontend-&gt;backend</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why not Hypergen?</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>every frontend change on the frontend requires a call to the server</li>
<li>python templating is not for everyone. Using Django templates is possible but not as polished yet</li>

<p>The basic form that makes Hypergen great (for me) is exemplified in this simple counter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from hypergen.core import *
from hypergen.core import callback as cb
from hypergen.contrib import hypergen_view, hypergen_callback, NO_PERM_REQUIRED

from django.templatetags.static import static

&#64;hypergen_view(perm=NO_PERM_REQUIRED)
def counter(request):
    doctype()
    with html():
        with head():
            script(src=static(&quot;hypergen/hypergen.min.js&quot;))
        with body(id_=&quot;body&quot;):
            template(1)

&#64;hypergen_callback(perm=NO_PERM_REQUIRED, target_id=&quot;body&quot;)
def increment(request, n):
    template(n + 1)

def template(n):
    label(&quot;Current value: &quot;)
    input_(id_=&quot;n&quot;, type_=&quot;number&quot;, value=n)
    button(&quot;Increment&quot;, id_=&quot;increment&quot;, onclick=cb(increment, n))
</pre>

<h1>My personal journal to Hypergen</h1>
<p>The journey leading up to building hypergen has been 15 years of experimenting with all the different methodologies of building websites for advanced business applications. It went something like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Custom non-frameworky PHP: Totally great cowboy style. Everything is a already a template.</li>
<li>Drupal obession: Why am I programming an UI for us programmers to build the site when we could just program the site? Try to think about the problem on your own before following current &quot;best practices&quot;. Use a framework that is actually a framework.</li>
<li>Switch to Django. Wow there is actually all the features I need, and great docs too. Ahh python makes sense. Django forms and the request/response cycle is great. Python is not a template language, hmm i guess djangos templates are ok.</li>
<li>Frontend level1: We need dynamic features, use the jQuery language to sprinkle behaviour where needed. State management is hard. Disconnect between server and client.</li>
<li>Frontend level2: Oh noohs the jQuery is unmanageable. Lets use handlebars templates, a persistent state and render everything on each state change. Rerendering is sluggish for large pages.</li>
<li>Frontend level3: Please save me React. State management is finally kind of nice. Everything is a template. Wow building duplicate functionality on the server and the client is annoying. A lot of the code is just about shuffling data between the server and the client. I miss python and all the great stuff in Django.</li>
<li>Why can't I just write my html in python and have frontend events call python functions? Actually I can, enter Hypergen :)</li>
</ul>
